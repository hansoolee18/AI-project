Dangerous recognition system based on AI
Intro: There are many microphones surrounding us, maybe much more than we thought Tons of audios we can utilize from these microphone, have potentials to provide necessary and useful information. Many researches are pointing out this fact and developing technology in this field. However it’s actually far from being commercialized because of some reaons. In this project, we’ll use these rich information of computing device around us, to recognize the context of our situations. Especially for danger context detection
Data gathering: As we mentioned before, we used AudioSet, which provides youtube link of 10-second video soundtracks and human-labeled sound names. https://research.google.com/audioset/
Data augmentation: Pre-processing -> Amplitude Augmentations -> Persistence Augmentations -> Mixing Augmentations
Model Construction using VGGISH: Reference: https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/audioset/vggish
